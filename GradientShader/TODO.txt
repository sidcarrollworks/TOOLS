# GRADIENT SHADER - TODO LIST

## IMMEDIATE TASKS
- Fix any remaining export issues or edge cases

## HIGH PRIORITY
- Add preset saving/loading functionality
  * Local storage implementation
  * File-based import/export
- Add button and shortcut to hide UI
  * Keyboard shortcut (e.g., 'H')
  * Small toggle button that remains visible
  * Possibly show a small ad when UI is open, hide when closed
  * Future: one-time payment option to remove ads

## USER EXPERIENCE
- Enhanced GUI organization
  * Group related controls more logically
  * Add collapsible sections for advanced options
- Tooltips and help
  * Add tooltips explaining each parameter
  * Include a help section or tutorial
- Undo/redo functionality
  * Track parameter changes
  * Allow users to step backward/forward through changes
- Responsive design improvements
  * Better mobile support
  * Adaptive UI based on screen size

## VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS
- Additional gradient interpolation methods
  * Add more interpolation algorithms (cubic, sinusoidal, etc.)
  * Implement custom curve editors
- Post-processing effects
  * Bloom, vignette, chromatic aberration
  * Customizable post-processing stack
- Alternative geometry options
  * Spheres, cubes, custom meshes
  * Multiple objects with different shader parameters
- Animation presets
  * Predefined animation sequences
  * Keyframe animation system
- Audio reactivity
  * React to music or audio input
  * Frequency analysis visualization
  * Beat detection for animation sync

## TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
- Performance optimizations
  * Shader code efficiency improvements
  * Adaptive quality based on device performance
- WebGL 2.0 features
  * Utilize advanced features when available
  * Fallback gracefully to WebGL 1.0
- Worker thread support
  * Move heavy computations off the main thread
  * Improve responsiveness during complex operations
- Comprehensive testing
  * Unit tests for core functionality
  * Cross-browser compatibility testing

## INTEGRATION & EXPORT
- Additional export formats
  * GLSL snippet export
  * React/Vue/Angular component export
- Live preview in export modal
  * Show a small preview of the shader while exporting
  * Allow parameter adjustments in the export view
- Export as image sequence
  * Generate a series of images for animation
  * Support various image formats and resolutions
- Integration with other tools
  * Export to CodePen/CodeSandbox
  * Integration with popular frameworks

## DOCUMENTATION & COMMUNITY
- Comprehensive documentation
  * API documentation
  * Usage examples and tutorials
- Gallery of examples
  * Showcase of different possible effects
  * Community submissions
- Plugin system
  * Allow third-party extensions
  * Custom shader modules

## MONETIZATION (FUTURE)
- One-time payment to remove ads
- Premium presets or features
- Licensing options for commercial use

## REFACTORING & CODE QUALITY
- Continue modularizing large files
- Improve code documentation
- Standardize naming conventions
- Optimize resource management
