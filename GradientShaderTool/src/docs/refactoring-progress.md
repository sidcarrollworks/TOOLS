# Gradient Shader Tool Refactoring Progress

## Completed Work

### Foundation Classes

1. **SignalStoreBase**: Created a standardized store class extending the original StoreBase but enhanced with signal-based state management.

   - Implemented methods for creating, tracking and connecting signals to state
   - Added utilities for automatic facade synchronization
   - Provided consistent interface for store operations

2. **FacadeSignalBridge**: Added a bridge to standardize the connection between signals and the shader app facade.

   - Implemented binding patterns for facade parameters
   - Added support for bidirectional updates
   - Included safeguards to prevent circular updates

3. **SharedSignals**: Created a registry for managing shared signals across components.

   - Implemented registration mechanisms for global signals
   - Added methods to access signals by key
   - Included typed access patterns for type safety

4. **SignalUtils**: Added utility functions for working with signals efficiently.

   - Implemented debouncing and throttling utilities
   - Added methods for controlled signal propagation
   - Provided helpers for component integration

5. **useSignals Custom Hooks**: Created specialized hooks for component integration.

   - Implemented hooks for reading and updating signals
   - Added performance optimization hooks (debounce, throttle)
   - Created hooks for facade synchronization

6. **InitializerBase**: Implemented a standardized base class for parameter initializers.
   - Added support for parameter definitions with metadata
   - Implemented facade synchronization
   - Created utilities for single and batch parameter updates

   - âœ… Refactored GeometryPanel to use GeometryStore with proper initializer patterns
   - âœ… Refactored PresetPanel to use PresetStore with initializer patterns
   - âœ… Refactored SavePanel to use ExportStore with ExportInitializer

2. **Fixed Panel Issues**:

   - âœ… Corrected normal noise parameter handling in DistortionPanel
   - âœ… Repaired camera controls to properly sync with 3D view
   - âœ… Enhanced ExportPanel with better code and image export options

3. **Removed Unused Components**:
   - âœ… Removed CodePanel component (May 2024)
   - âœ… Removed export from Panels/index.ts
   - âœ… Confirmed all code export functionality works through modal interface

### UI Improvements

1. **Enhanced UI Component Library**:

   - âœ… Created StandardSlider with consistent styling
   - âœ… Implemented SettingsGroup for logical UI organization
   - âœ… Added improved CSS modules for consistent appearance
   - âœ… Created DirectionControl with intuitive input handling

2. **Improved User Experience**:

   - âœ… Reduced debounce times for all panel components
   - âœ… Enhanced camera controls with proper reactivity
   - âœ… Fixed transparent background synchronization
   - âœ… Added better parameter validation and error handling

3. **Export Improvements**:
   - âœ… Enhanced JavaScript export with comprehensive camera setup
   - âœ… Improved syntax highlighting for exported code
   - âœ… Added detailed usage instructions for code exports
   - âœ… Fixed high-quality export functionality
