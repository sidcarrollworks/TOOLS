# GradientBar Component - Remaining Tasks

## 1. Update Presets for New Gradient Bar

The current presets system needs to be updated to properly work with our enhanced GradientBar component:

- Update the preset data structure to include color stops array rather than individual color properties
- Ensure the preset loading/saving mechanism correctly handles the new format
- Add migration logic to convert older presets with color1-4 format to the new colorStops array format
- Test preset application to ensure color stops are correctly applied when loading a preset

## 2. Create Color Picker Popover

Implement a new color picker component that appears in a popover directly over the selected color stop, similar to this design:

**Design Reference:**

- 2D color field with black to white on Y-axis and pure color to white on X-axis
- Circular handle to indicate selected color (currently showing a purple tone)
- Hue slider below the main picker with a circular handle
- Numerical display of the hue degree (259.06Â°)
- Hex input field for direct color code entry (#5100FF)

Requirements:

- Create a new `ColorPickerPopover` component with:
  - 2D color picker area (saturation/brightness)
  - Hue slider for selecting base color
  - Hexadecimal input field
  - Degree display for hue value
- Position the popover to appear directly above the selected color stop
- Add transition/animation for smooth appearance/disappearance
- Ensure the popover closes when clicking outside
- Handle edge cases when color stop is near screen edge
- Update the selected color stop in real-time as the color is adjusted

Suggested structure:

```tsx
interface ColorPickerPopoverProps {
  color: string;
  onChange: (color: string) => void;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  onClose: () => void;
}
```

## 3. Implement Gradient Mode Visualization

The gradient display should change based on the selected gradient mode:

### Gradient Modes

1. **B-Spline**: Smooth curved interpolation between color stops
2. **Linear**: Straight-line interpolation between adjacent stops
3. **Step**: Hard transitions between colors at each stop position
4. **Smooth Step**: Smooth transitions with eased edges at each stop

Implementation tasks:

- Create CSS representations for each gradient mode
- For B-Spline and other advanced modes, consider using SVG or Canvas rendering
- Update the GradientBar component to accept a `gradientMode` prop
- Implement visual preview of how gradient will appear in each mode
- Ensure gradient preview updates when mode changes
- Consider adding helper methods to convert between gradient modes:
  ```ts
  function getGradientStyle(stops: ColorStop[], mode: GradientMode): string;
  ```

## 4. Performance Optimization

Once the above features are implemented, consider these optimizations:

- Memoize expensive calculations using useMemo
- Add debouncing for real-time color/position updates
- Optimize rendering with React.memo for sub-components
- Consider virtualization if supporting very large numbers of color stops

## 5. Accessibility Improvements

- Add keyboard navigation for color stops
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes on all interactive elements
- Add screen reader descriptions for the color picker
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
