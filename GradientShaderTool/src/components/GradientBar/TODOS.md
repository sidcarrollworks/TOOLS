# GradientBar Component - Remaining Tasks

## ✅ 1. Create Color Picker Popover

Implemented a new color picker component that appears in a popover directly over the selected color stop, similar to this design:

**Design Reference:**

- 2D color field with black to white on Y-axis and pure color to white on X-axis
- Circular handle to indicate selected color (currently showing a purple tone)
- Hue slider below the main picker with a circular handle
- Numerical display of the hue degree (259.06°)
- Hex input field for direct color code entry (#5100FF)

Implementation details:

- Created `ColorPickerPopover.tsx` component with:
  - 2D color picker area (saturation/brightness)
  - Hue slider for selecting base color
  - Hexadecimal input field
  - Degree display for hue value
- The popover appears directly above the selected color stop
- Added smooth transition/animation for appearance/disappearance
- Popover closes when clicking outside
- Updates the selected color stop in real-time as the color is adjusted

## 4. Performance Optimization

Once the above features are implemented, consider these optimizations:

- Memoize expensive calculations using useMemo
- Add debouncing for real-time color/position updates
- Optimize rendering with React.memo for sub-components
- Consider virtualization if supporting very large numbers of color stops

## 5. Accessibility Improvements

- Add keyboard navigation for color stops
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes on all interactive elements
- Add screen reader descriptions for the color picker
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
