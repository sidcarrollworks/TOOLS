## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Changes

The rewrite maintains the same core functionality as the original project but with several architectural improvements:

1. **TypeScript Integration**: Added type safety throughout the codebase
2. **Component-Based UI**: Replaced dat.GUI with Preact components for better customization
3. **Module Structure**: Maintained the same module separation but with better type definitions
4. **Responsive Design**: Improved layout for different screen sizes
5. **State Management**: Using Preact's signals for reactive state management
6. **Improved UI/UX**: Added keyboard shortcuts and auto-hiding UI elements for a cleaner experience
7. **Custom Input Components**: Created Figma-inspired input components for a more professional look
8. **Multiple Geometry Types**: Support for planes, spheres, and cubes with dedicated shaders

### Challenges

1. **dat.GUI Replacement**: Creating a custom UI to replace dat.GUI functionality
2. **Three.js Integration**: Ensuring proper cleanup and initialization with Preact lifecycle
3. **Type Definitions**: Adding proper TypeScript types for Three.js and shader parameters
4. **UI State Management**: Coordinating UI state between multiple components (settings panel, stats, keyboard hints)
5. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing visual quality with performance
6. **Shader Compatibility**: Ensuring shaders work correctly across different geometry types

## Testing Plan

1. Test each parameter control to ensure it updates the shader correctly
2. Test presets to ensure they apply all parameters correctly
3. Test export functionality for both images and code
4. Test on different browsers and devices
5. Test performance with different parameter values
6. Test keyboard shortcuts in different UI states
7. Cross-browser compatibility testing
8. Test different geometry types and their specific shaders
